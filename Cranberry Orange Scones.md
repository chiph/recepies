Delicious Scones!

  *  270 g all-purpose flour
  *  7 g baking powder
  *  5 g salt
  *  64 g Sugar
  *  6 tbsp. (85 g/3 oz) unsalted butter, frozen

  *  3/4 cup (177 g/6.25 oz) heavy cream, chilled
  *  2 eggs, beaten
  *  Zest of two oranges
  *  1/3 cup dried cranberries chopped
  
1. I like to mix the cream, eggs and orange zest ahead of time, allowing the flavor from the zest to really come through. I usually mix these the night before but a few hours is probably plenty.
2. Mix/sift the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a bowl
3. Cut the butter into pieces and add to the flour mixture. "Cut" the butter into the flour mixture. I have found that wearing latex gloves (to avoid melting the butter) and rubbing the butter between my finders works well. You want to get the mix to a wet sand texture.
4. At this point, I will usually throw the bowl into the freezer ovenight - you want the butter cold when you bake the scones (again probably more time than needed)
5. Preheat the oven to 375F
6. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in the cream. Mix using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula
7. Mix in the cranberries
8. Knead dough on a floured surface - wax paper or a silpat. The dough will be sticky! Add only enough flour to make the dough workable
9. Roll out into a 1" thick disc or square - cut into 8 triangles. You can use a biscuit or cookie cutter too
10. Put scones onto an ungreased baking sheet 1" apart
11. Bake 23-25 minutes / until golden brown
12. Cool on rack
