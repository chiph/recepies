Delicious Scones!

  *  270 g all-purpose flour
  *  7 g baking powder
  *  5 g salt
  *  64 g Sugar
  *  6 tbsp. (85 g/3 oz) unsalted butter, frozen

  *  3/4 cup (177 g/6.25 oz) heavy cream, chilled
  *  2 eggs, beaten
  *  Zest of two oranges
  *  1/3 cup dried cranberries chopped
  
1. I like to mix the cream, eggs and orange zest ahead of time, allowing the flavor from the zest to really come through. I usually mix these the night before but a few hours is probably plenty.
2. Mix/sift the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a bowl
3. Cut the butter into pieces and add to the flour mixture. "Cut" the butter into the flour mixture. I have found that wearing latex gloves (to avoid melting the butter) and rubbing the butter between my finders works well. You want to get the mix to a wet sand texture.
4. At this point, I will usually throw the bowl into the freezer ovenight - you want the butter cold when you bake the scones (again probably more time than needed)
5. Preheat the oven to 375F
6. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in the cream. Mix using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula
7. Mix in the cranberries
8. Knead dough on a floured surface - wax paper or a silpat. The dough will be sticky! Add only enough flour to make the dough workable
9. Roll out into a 1" thick disc or square - cut into 8 triangles. You can use a biscuit or cookie cutter too
10. Put scones onto an ungreased baking sheet 1" apart
11. Bake 23-25 minutes / until golden brown
12. Cool on rack

-----

    2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled), plus more for hands and work surface
    1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
    2 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/2 cup (1 stick; 115g) unsalted butter, frozen
    1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream (plus 2 Tbsp for brushing)
    1 large egg
    1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
	
	Variations:
	Cranberry-orange
	1 C dried cranberries chopped
	zest of 2 oranges
	
	Blueberry
    1 heaping cup (180g) fresh or frozen blueberries (do not thaw)
    1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	
Instructions

   * Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs. See video above for a closer look at the texture. Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.
   * Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. IF making the cranberry-orange scones, add zest
   * Drizzle wet mix over the flour mixture, add the blueberries or cranberries, then mix together until everything appears moistened.
   * Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball as best you can. Dough will be sticky. If it’s too sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges.
   * Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or after refrigerating in the next step.)
   * Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.
   * Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).
   * Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s).
   * Bake for 22-25 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top. Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes before topping with vanilla icing.
   * Leftover iced or un-iced scones keep well at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for 5 days.
