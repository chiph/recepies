### Prepare
* Combine marinade/chicken in large zip-top bag, let sit in fridge overnight. Probably good idea to place sealed bag inside a large bowl just in case.

### Sauce

* Melt two T butter in large saucepan or Duch oven - medium-high heat (Dutch oven may be better, especially if using immersion blender later)
* Add onion, garlic, ginger, and chile, stirring frequently, until mixture softens and onion begins to brown (8-10 minutes)
* Add garam masala, coriander, cumin, black pepper and chili powder and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
* Add water/tomato and whisk until no lumps of tomato remain. Add sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil.
* Remove from heat, stir in cream. 
* Using immersion blender or blender, process until smooth, 30 to 60 seconds.
* Return sauce to simmer over medium heat and whisk in remaining butter one T at a time. Stir in fenugreek.
* Remove saucepan from heat and cover to keep warm.

### Chicken
* Adjust top rack of oven to 6" from broiler element, heat broiler
* Transfer chicken to wire rack set in a foil—lined rimmed baking sheet.
* Broil until chicken is evenly charred on both sides and registers 175 degrees, 16 to 20 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through broiling.
* Let chicken rest about 5 minutes, warm the sauce on medium-high heat.

### Alternate way of preparing/cooking chicken 

* Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces before adding to marinade
* Pan-fry pieces in 2T olive oil in batches (saving juices) on medium-high heat before building sauce in same pan. Keep any brown bits that form, scraping bottom of pan & building the sauce including these
* When it comes time, add chicken/juices to sauce
